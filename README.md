# Project Description

In this project, you can experience your classic notebook experience. Written in the C # programming language, this program offers you many features. Apart from that, many features not added in these versions can be added according to your wishes. For this, it will be enough to send an e-mail to github@maces.ga.
It is better than most classic notebooks with its in-built features. It is ready to use both portable and built-in with only the .exe setup. You can easily get rid of .dll files as it does not contain NuGet packages. Just download -> run -> use. Using C # in the development language makes it faster, more stable and does not require an additional package.
